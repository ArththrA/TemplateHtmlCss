						<p>Norway: a prosperous, peaceful country deeply connected to nature.</p>
						<h2>Norway</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The history of Norway begins with the first people who inhabited the region after the end of the Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago. These people were hunters and gatherers who explored Scandinavia's abundant nature. Over time, agricultural and maritime communities emerged, which set the stage for one of the most defining periods in Norwegian history: the Viking Age.</p>

					<p>Between the 8th and 11th centuries, Norwegian Vikings became known as explorers, warriors and traders. They set out on long journeys across the sea, reaching Scotland, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland and even the coast of North America, around the year 1000. During this period, King Harold Fairhair unified the different clans and tribes, giving rise to the first kingdom of Norway around the year 872.</p>

					<p>The Christianization of Norway occurred gradually between the 10th and 11th centuries, with the help of kings such as Olaf Tryggvason and Olaf II, who would later be canonized as Saint Olaf, the country's patron saint. With Christianity came new power structures and the strengthening of the monarchy.</p>
					
					<p>In the Middle Ages, Norway became part of the so-called Kalmar Union, a political alliance with Denmark and Sweden, formed in 1397. After Sweden's departure, Norway remained united with Denmark for almost 400 years. This period, known as "the 400 years of night", was marked by Danish domination and the decline of Norwegian political influence.</p>
					<p>In 1814, with the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was ceded to Sweden by the Treaty of Kiel, but tried to proclaim its independence by drafting its own constitution on May 17 of that year — a date that is still celebrated today as Norwegian National Day. Despite this, the country was forced into a union with Sweden, but maintained a certain amount of autonomy.
					</p>
					<p>This union with Sweden lasted until 1905, when Norway finally gained its complete independence and chose a new king: Haakon VII, of Danish origin, who accepted the throne after a popular referendum. The constitutional monarchy established then continues to this day.</p>
					<p>During the Second World War, Norway was occupied by Nazi Germany between 1940 and 1945. After the war, the country began to invest heavily in its development, joining NATO in 1949, although it decided not to join the European Union in referenda held in 1972 and 1994.</p>
					<p>The discovery of oil in the North Sea in the 1960s transformed the Norwegian economy, allowing the country to create one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world, used to guarantee the well-being of future generations. Today, Norway is known for its high standard of living, its effective social policies and its commitment to sustainability and human rights.</p>

						<p>Finland: a peaceful, innovative, and nature-loving country.</p>
						<h2>Finland</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The history of Finland is one of resilience, cultural identity, and the pursuit of independence. Human settlement in Finland began after the last Ice Age, around 9,000 BCE, with hunter-gatherer communities gradually spreading across the region. Over time, these groups developed distinct languages and traditions, giving rise to what we now recognize as the Finno-Ugric culture, from which the Finnish language descends.</p>
					<p>During the Middle Ages, Finland was gradually integrated into the Kingdom of Sweden, beginning in the 12th century through crusades and political expansion. For several centuries, Finland remained part of Sweden, adopting Swedish laws, religion (Christianity), and administration. Many Finnish nobles and townspeople spoke Swedish, and it became the language of government and education.</p>
					<p>In 1809, after Sweden lost a war to Russia, Finland was ceded to the Russian Empire and became the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. Although it remained under Russian rule, Finland retained its own laws, institutions, and even a separate currency. This period saw the growth of a strong Finnish national identity, with a cultural movement promoting the Finnish language and traditions. In 1835, the national epic Kalevala was published, becoming a cornerstone of Finnish identity.</p>
					<p>In 1917, amid the chaos of the Russian Revolution, Finland declared independence. A brief but bloody civil war followed in 1918, between the "Reds" (socialists) and the "Whites" (conservatives), with the Whites emerging victorious. Finland then became a republic, and over the next two decades, worked to stabilize its democracy.</p>
					<p>During World War II, Finland fought the Soviet Union twice: first in the Winter War (1939–1940), where it resisted Soviet invasion, and later in the Continuation War (1941–1944), allied with Nazi Germany to reclaim lost territory. After the war, Finland lost land to the USSR and paid heavy reparations, but remained independent and democratic.</p>
					<p>Throughout the Cold War, Finland maintained a policy of neutrality, balancing relations between the East and the West — a policy sometimes referred to as "Finlandization." Despite being close to the Soviet sphere, it remained a market economy with strong democratic institutions.</p>
					<p>In 1995, Finland joined the European Union, and in 2023, it became a member of NATO, ending decades of military non-alignment. Today, Finland is known for its strong education system, social welfare, technological innovation, and high quality of life — consistently ranking among the happiest countries in the world./p>
